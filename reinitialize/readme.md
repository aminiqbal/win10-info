# ReInitialize
Once too many unnecessary, ill-managed, or lingering processes have accumulated on our windows instance and we don't want to shut down
or sign out, we can simply run the batch script with admin privileges to end those needlessly resource consuming processes.
We are able to also edit the processes we'd like NOT to end as well.

# Usage
Please refer to [reinitialize.ps1](https://github.com/aminiqbal/win10-info/blob/main/reinitialize/reinitialize.ps1).
* We must have both these files for this to work:
  * [reinitialize.bat](https://github.com/aminiqbal/win10-info/blob/main/reinitialize/reinitialize.bat)
  * [reinitialize.ps1](https://github.com/aminiqbal/win10-info/blob/main/reinitialize/reinitialize.ps1)
